Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

The ``pyprec`` package is open source and available at https://github.com/marcorossi5/pyprec.git

The package can be installed manually:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/marcorossi5/pyprec.git
  cd pyprec
  pip install -e .

Motivation
----------

Creating Python packages base structure is a repetitive work that can be
automatized with the ``pyprec`` software

Creating a new project from repo
--------------------------------

``pyprec`` automates the creation of Python Packages from a fresh new GitHub
repository.

The idea is that most of the packages share a similar structure, which requires
to tweak just a few variables (e.g. `package name`, `author name`, etc.).

To start creating your python package repository structure, just run ``pyprec``
command and answer the prompted questions.
